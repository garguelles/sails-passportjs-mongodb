              For demonstration purposes, the `title` is dynamically set here based on
              your `sails.config.appName` to show that you can inject data into layouts
              exactly the same way as with your other view templates.
          
    title
    //
       Viewport mobile tag for sensible mobile support 
    meta(name='viewport', content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1')
    //
            Stylesheets
            ========================
            You can link any CSS, LESS, or image files in your `assets` directory
            as you would normally: using <link/> tags.
            
          
    //
            Support for LESS included by default
            ================================================
            LESS files are automatically compiled when they change using the Gruntfile
            located in the top-level of this Sails app.  If you run into issues with styles
            not reloading, check the Sails log output in your console for LESS compilation errors.
            If necessary, shut down and then lift your app again.
